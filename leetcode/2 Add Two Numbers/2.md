# 2 Add Two Numbers

## Description
&emsp;You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

&emsp;You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

**Input**: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)

**Output**: 7 -> 0 -> 8

## Solution
### Intuition

&emsp;Keep track of the carry using a variable and simulate digits-by-digits sum starting from the head of list, which contains the least-significant digit.

Each node contains a single digit and the digits are stored in reverse order.

### Algorithm

&emsp;Just like how you would sum two numbers on a piece of paper, we begin by summing the least-significant digits, which is the head of l1 and l2. Since each digit is in the range of 0... 9, summing two digits may "overflow". For example 5 + 7 = 12. In this case, we set the current digit to 2 and bring over the carry = 1 to the next iteration. carry must be either 0 or 1 because the largest possible sum of two digits (including the carry) is 9 + 9 + 1 = 19.

The pseudocode is as following:
- Initialize current node to dummy head of the returning list.
- Initialize carry to 0.
- Initialize p and q to head of l1 and l2 respectively.
- Loop through lists l1 and l2 until you reach both ends.
	- Set x to node pp's value. If pp has reached the end of l1, set to 0.
	- Set y to node qq's value. If qq has reached the end of l2, set to 0.
	- Set sum = x + y + carrysum=x+y+carry.
	- Update carry = sum / 10.
	- Create a new node with the digit value of (sum \bmod 10)(summod10) and set it to current node's next, then advance current node to next.
	- Advance both pp and qq.
- Check if carry = 1carry=1, if so append a new node with digit 11 to the returning list.
- Return dummy head's next node.

Note that we use a dummy head to simplify the code. Without a dummy head, you would have to write extra conditional statements to initialize the head's value.

#### JAVA
```java
public ListNode addTwoNumbers(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
    ListNode dummyHead = new ListNode(0);
    ListNode p = l1, q = l2, curr = dummyHead;
    int carry = 0;
    while (p != null || q != null) {
        int x = (p != null) ? p.val : 0;
        int y = (q != null) ? q.val : 0;
        int sum = carry + x + y;
        carry = sum / 10;
        curr.next = new ListNode(sum % 10);
        curr = curr.next;
        if (p != null) p = p.next;
        if (q != null) q = q.next;
    }
    if (carry > 0) {
        curr.next = new ListNode(carry);
    }
    return dummyHead.next;
}
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Time complexity : O(max(m,n)). Assume that m and nn represents the length of l1 and l2 respectively, the algorithm above iterates at most max(m,n) times.

Space complexity :O(max(m,n)). The length of the new list is at most max(m,n)+1.

#### Follow up

What if the the digits in the linked list are stored in non-reversed order? For example:
 (3→4→2)+(4→6→5)=8→0→7
